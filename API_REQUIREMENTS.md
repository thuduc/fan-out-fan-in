I need to add a rest API to the existing system using the following requirements.
- Refer to DESIGN.md for how the current codebase is implemented
- I want to add the following rest resources to vnapi (under the vnapi folder):
  - POST to /valuation?sync=Y, where the payload is the request xml. The sync query param can be Y or N. If Y, it's a synchronous request. If N, it's an asynchronous request. Here's the expected behavior for sync and async:
    - first, the implementation of this rest resource will write the XML to Redis Cache `cache:request:<id>:xml`
    - then if sync=Y, vnapi then needs to wait for the xml request result from vnvs, before returning the result to the client. Use redis stream & cache to implement this functionality.
    - else if sync=N, vnapi then returns the generated request id (uuid)
  - GET to /valuation/:reqId/status to return the status of the current request
  - GET to /valuation/:reqId/results to return the xml results of the previously submitted request using the request id
- Use express.js for the rest API implementation
- Store the design to a file name API_DESIGN.md
- Do not create any code. Only come up with a detailed design. Think hard to make sure that changes to existing services will not break existing functionality
